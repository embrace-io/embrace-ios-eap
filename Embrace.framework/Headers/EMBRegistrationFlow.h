 Starts a registration moment.

 an external service (e.g. Google, Facebook, GitHub Login).

 @param userId An identifier that uniquely represents the user (e.g. frequent flyer number). This value is optional
               and, if present, will associate the value as a property of the moment.
 @param username The username of the user. This value is optional and, if present, will associate the value as a
                 property of the moment.
 @param email The email address of the user. This value is optional and, if present, will associate the value as a
              property of the moment.
 @param properties A map of Strings to Objects that represent additional properties to associate with the moment.
                   This value is optional. A maximum of 10 properties (not including the ones set via arguments to
                   this method) may be set.
